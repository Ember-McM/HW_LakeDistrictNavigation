The top section, which is also the highest cascade, is split by an outcrop of rock and falls into a small pool surrounded by a few Rowan trees, then continues downwards through two smaller cascades. The middle cascade falls into a larger pool which has scattered Juniper around it. The bottom cascade is smallest of the three, after which the Beck enters a small wooded gorge containing further smaller falls. The Beck then levels out in the bottom of the Newlands Valley as it is joined by High Hole Beck and becomes Keskadale Beck.",
