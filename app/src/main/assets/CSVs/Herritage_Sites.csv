Latterbarrow,"Latterbarrow is a hill in the English Lake District, east of Hawkshead, Cumbria. Latterbarrow is home to an amazing variety of plants with over 200 species recorded. The underlying limestone rock, combined with a mix of grassland, ash and hazel woodland and scrub provides a variety of habitats. Yew and the rare Lancastrian whitebeam are particular features of the woodland, but the flower-rich grassland steals the show.  Ash and hazel woodland covers about half of the nature reserve. With early-purple orchid and cowslips opening the sequence in May, greater butterfly and fragrant orchids follow in June, and the display becomes even more colourful in July. By varying the timing of the grazing, flowers set seed periodically, which ensures the continuing diversity in the grassland. The resulting abundance of nectar makes Latterbarrow a haven for insect life. ",,,54.3840,-2.9742,nature

Whitewater Dash,"Whitewater Dash is a spectacular waterfall on the Dash Beck in the Cumberland Lake District, east of Bassenthwaite. It is reckoned one of the finest waterfalls in Lakeland. The fall, sometimes called ‘Dash Falls’, is found in the narrow dale between Little Calva to the east and Bakestall, a subsidiary fell of mighty Skiddaw, to the west. It is just below the head of the valley Dash Beck, which begins on the felltop in Candleseaves Bog. The water gathered from the bog into a new river here tumbles in a long series of cascades down the precipitous sides of the fells towards the comparatively lower ground beneath, in which lies Bassenthwaite Lake. The dramatic course of the beck turns the water into a white ribbon and Wainwright called it the finest succession of falls in Lakeland. Nevertheless, the remote location leaves the fall relatively unvisited and unspoiled.",,,54.6727,-3.1237,nature
